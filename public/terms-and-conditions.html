Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you retain all right, title, and interest – including any intellectual property rights – that you have in and to your Prompts.

        <h2>3. CentGPT AIS Data</h2>
        <p>
            We collect personal and non-personal data to improve our services. Data use is governed by our Privacy Policy, available at nexthomelabs.com/centgpt/privacy-policy.
            The nexthomelabs.com/centgpt/privacy-policy governs our processing of personal information processed through the AIs and explains how we collect, use, and share personal information - including personal information you submit as Prompts, Feedback, or other Content, your activity across our products, and personal information we collect from and about your device. We process personal information, including information on sensitive topics, as described in the Privacy Policy, to improve AIs and related technology.
            When information is shared with AIs, the AIs may retain and use that information to provide more personalized Outputs. Do not share information that you don’t want the AIs to use and retain such as account identifiers, passwords, financial information, or other sensitive topics.
            If the AIs cannot answer your query, or if our systems determine that a more relevant or up-to-date response could be provided by a partner, we may ask a third party to provide a response. For example, in these cases we share questions contained in a Prompt and limited metadata to enable a more accurate answer with a third-party search engine, and include the search results in the response to your Prompt. The information we share with third parties may contain personal information if your Prompt contains personal information about any person. By using AIs, you are instructing us to share your information with third parties when it provides you with more relevant or useful responses. Those third parties will use any information we share – which could include personal information about you or others if you include such information in your Prompt– in accordance with those third parties’ privacy policies. You can view the list of these third parties, and links to their privacy policies, by visiting our Privacy Center. We add or remove third parties from time to time, and notice will be provided solely by adding or removing that party from the list referenced above.
            In some cases, Meta will review your interactions with AIs, including the content of your conversations with or messages to AIs, and this review can be automated or manual (human).
            Depending on where you reside, you or an authorized agent may request access to your personal information from Meta in a portable format, deletion of your personal information, or correction of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions. To learn more about how you can access and delete your personal information associated with AIs, and exercise any applicable rights, visit our Privacy Center. It is important that you review the Privacy Center before you try to delete any personal information or delete or deactivate your account. Depending on how you use AIs, deleting individual messages, entire threads, or even your account may not delete our copy of your personal information, and the Privacy Center describes the correct way to delete your personal information.
            C. Accuracy
            AIs are a new technology that are still improving in accuracy. As such the accuracy of any content, including outputs cannot be guaranteed and that outputs may be disturbing or upsetting. You should not rely upon outputs for any purpose or use outputs to inform professional advice or decisions related to medicine, finance, law or pharmaceuticals. If you plan to use outputs for any reason, it is your sole responsibility to verify outputs. AIs and any content may not reflect accurate, complete or current information.
            D. Warning Regarding Content
            The AIs will generate Content based on Prompts that you provide. The specific Content that the AIs will return based on your Prompts cannot be predicted in advance. AIs might generate content that you consider offensive or objectionable and/or that does not represent Meta’s views. By agreeing to these terms and by using ais, you recognize and assume the risk that the prompts you provide might result in generation of content that you consider offensive or objectionable. you also recognize and agree that you – not meta – are responsible for your use of, and/or any actions you take in relation to, content generated by the ais based on your prompts.
